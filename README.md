# Backend for Decentral Goods
Decentral Goods is an online marketplace with decentralization at its core for secure payments. This was made as a project for "Solidity Cohort" an online course I attended about Solidity. The different libraries and tools I have used for the frontend are:
- Express
- EtherJS
- Alchemy (For Blockchain RPC)
- Solidity (For writing the smart contract)
- NodeJS
- Postgres
- Vercel (For Hosting)
